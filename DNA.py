"""
A DNA can be an array of floats with values from 0 to 1.
First 2 are the coordinates of first triangle points, second 2 for second point and third for third.
Then we will have a 3 values representing colors in triangle.
And for 100 triangles we have array containing 900 values.

To change DNA we can slightly change values of network.
Each value change by some randomly choice value for example in range(0.01, 0.1).
